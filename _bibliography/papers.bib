  abstract={In this paper, we consider a closed Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with dimension $3\leq n+1\leq 7$, and a compact Lie group G acting as isometries on M with cohomogeneity at least $3$. 
            After adapting the Almgren–Pitts min–max theory to a $G$-equivariant version, we show the existence of a non-trivial closed smooth embedded $G$-invariant minimal hypersurface $\Sigma \subset M$ provided that the union of non-principal orbits forms a smooth embedded submanifold of M with dimension at most $n-2$. 
            Moreover, we also build upper bounds as well as lower bounds of $(G, p)$-widths, which are analogs of the classical conclusions derived by Gromov and Guth. 
            An application of our results combined with the work of Marques–Neves shows the existence of infinitely many G-invariant minimal hypersurfaces when $Ric_M>0$ and orbits satisfy the same assumption above.

  abstract={Given a compact Riemannian manifold $M^{n+1}$ with dimension $3\leq n+1\leq 7$ and $\partial M\neq\emptyset$, the free boundary min-max theory built by Li-Zhou shows the existence of a smooth almost properly embedded minimal hypersurface with free boundary in $M$. 
            In this paper, we generalize their constructions into equivariant settings. 
            Specifically, let $G$ be a compact Lie group acting as isometries on $M$ with cohomogeneity at least $3$. 
            Then there exists a nontrivial smooth almost properly embedded free boundary $G$-invariant minimal hypersurface. 
            Moreover, if the Ricci curvature of $M$ is non-negative and $\partial M$ is strictly convex, then there exist infinitely many properly embedded $G$-invariant minimal hypersurfaces with free boundary. },

  abstract={For a closed Riemannian manifold $$M^{n+1}$$ with a compact Lie group G acting as isometries, the equivariant min–max theory gives the existence and the potential abundance of minimal G-invariant hypersurfaces provided $$3\le \textrm{codim}(G\cdot p) \le 7$$ for all $$p\in M$$. 
 	In this paper, we show a compactness theorem for these min–max minimal G-hypersurfaces and construct a G-invariant Jacobi field on the limit. 
	Combining with an equivariant bumpy metrics theorem, we obtain a $$C^\infty _G$$-generic finiteness result for min–max G-hypersurfaces with area uniformly bounded. 
	As a main application, we further generalize the Morse index estimates for min–max minimal hypersurfaces to the equivariant setting. 
	Namely, the closed G-invariant minimal hypersurface $$\Sigma \subset M$$ constructed by the equivariant min–max on a k-dimensional homotopy class can be chosen to satisfy $$\textrm{Index}_G(\Sigma )\le k$$.},

	As an application, we are able to establish a genus bound for $$\Sigma$$, a control on the singular points of $$\Sigma/G$$, and an upper bound for the (first) $$G$$-width of $$M$$ provided $$n+1=3$$ and the actions of $$G$$ are orientation preserving. },

  abstract={In this paper, we consider locally wedge-shaped manifolds, which are Riemannian manifolds that are allowed to have both boundary and certain types of edges. 
    We define and study the properties of free boundary minimal hypersurfaces inside locally wedge-shaped manifolds. 
    In particular, we show a compactness theorem for free boundary minimal hypersurfaces with curvature and area bounds in a locally wedge-shaped manifold. 
    Additionally, using Schoen-Simon-Yau’s estimates, we also prove a Bernstein-type theorem indicating that, under certain conditions, a stable free boundary minimal hypersurface inside a Euclidean wedge must be a portion of a hyperplane. 
    As our main application, we establish a curvature estimate for sufficiently regular free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in a locally wedge-shaped manifold. 
    We expect this curvature estimate will be useful for establishing a min-max theory for the area functional in wedge-shaped spaces.},

  abstract={We develop a min-max theory for the area functional in the class of locally wedge-shaped manifolds. Roughly speaking, a locally wedge-shaped manifold is a Riemannian manifold that is allowed to have both boundary and certain types of edges. 
        Fix a dimension $3 \le n+1 \le 6$. 
        As our main theorem, we prove that every compact locally wedge-shaped manifold $M^{n+1}$ with acute wedge angles contains a locally wedge-shaped free boundary minimal hypersurface $\Sigma^n$ which is smooth in its interior and on its faces and is $C^{2,\alpha}$ up to and including its edge. 
        We can also handle the case of 90 degree wedge angles under an additional assumption.},
